		"title": "About Me",
		"description": "I'm a fullstack developer from a small village near Dęblin (They have a pretty good IT technical school and an aviation school there). I love writing clean code and learning new, useful technologies for my stack. I specialize in React, .NET, and MongoDB. Currently, I'm working on a shopping center management system and building personal projects, such as a tenant turnover analytics platform (a project for my engineering thesis). In my free time, I explore cloud services and play around with Linux (Oracle Cloud), DevOps, and system automation. Most of the time, when my friends need a server—for example, for Minecraft—I'm the one who sets it up for them.",
